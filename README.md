- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence work fields. I have worked on some Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods by using datasets to achieve the relevant goals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fundamentals of Data Science and its applications. Python is the language that I am excited to develop my skills on. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which include analysis of a dataset and and performing a task on it by using sophisticated algorithms.
